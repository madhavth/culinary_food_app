    <string name="i_don_t_discriminate_i_love_all_recipes">My favorite recipes embody the essence of Nepali heritage. Dal bhat, a daily ritual, reflects resilience. Momo, those delicate dumplings, infuse gatherings with joy. Gundruk adds a traditional flair, and a cup of aromatic chai wraps it all in comforting warmth. These recipes, steeped in tradition, define my culinary journey.</string>
    <string name="food_philosophy">In the heart of Nepal, our food philosophy is a vibrant tapestry of traditions, spirituality, and a profound connection to nature. Rooted in the sacred Himalayas, each meal is a celebration, echoing the resilience found in our daily sustenance. Rice, the staple, symbolizes prosperity, while spices dance in harmony, reflecting the artistry in our kitchens. Momo, the delicate dumplings, embodies the warmth of Nepali hospitality, and tarkari showcases the vibrant hues of our land. Food is an offering to the divine, intertwining spirituality with sustenance, and festivals come alive through aromatic incense and sizzling feasts. From tea welcoming embrace to daalpithos sweet respite, our cuisine is a treasure trove of flavors telling tales of resilience and adaptability. Communal and shared, Nepali food is a ritual, a communion with nature and ancestors, preserving the tanginess of our stories in soulful pickles and fermented greens. Pungent mustard oil and ghee, the liquid gold, signify purity, nourishment, and a distinctive Nepali identity.</string>
